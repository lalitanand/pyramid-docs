============================
Getting Started With Pyramid
============================

Welcome to Pyramid, the Python web framework that lets you start small
and finish big. Whether you are new to Python web development or you're
an experienced developer wanting a quick look at the major
features, this guide provides a convenient entry point with independent
chapters for each topic.

About This Guide
================

Evaluators want to jump right into a particular topic. This *Getting
Started* guide is structured with chapter titles that focuses on a
particular aspect of web development. Each chapter is autonomous and
you don't have to follow from beginning to end.

By definition, each topic is covered at a high level. To make it easy
to get to in-depth treatment, the chapters provide interlinking with
the full treatment in the :ref:`html_narrative_documentation`.

This guide is part of the official documentation. If you find a bug,
you can report it using the same facilities as the described in the
software's :ref:`support-and-development`.
