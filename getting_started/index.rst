============================
Getting Started With Pyramid
============================

Welcome to Pyramid, the Python web framework that lets you start small
and finish big. Whether you are new to Python web development or you're
an experienced developer that wants a quick look at the major
features, this guide provides a convenient entry point with independent
chapters for each topic.

:doc:`quick_glance`
===================

Python web development is a very big topic. Wouldn't it be great to
have a quick overview, end-to-end, just to get oriented? This chapter
shows "a little about a lot", full of short code snippets and links to
deeper treatment of topics. Additionally, we showcase some facilities
that make Pyramid unique for "applications with ambition."

:doc:`about_guide`
==================

Now that we have set the scene, we explain the purpose of this guide
(and non-purpose), showing how it is organized.


:doc:`scaffolds`
================

Pyramid projects are organized using normal Python facilities for
projects. Normal, though, is in the eye of the beholder. This chapter
shows how to use scaffolds to automate the boilerplate and quickly
start development of a new project.

Topics: scaffolds, packaging, virtual environments
