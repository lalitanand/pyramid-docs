Databases With SQLAlchemy
=========================

We can now visit our sample at
`http://localhost:6543/ <http://localhost:6543/>`_. Some choices that
the scaffold helped us with:

- A ``setup.py`` with appropriate dependencies

- Connection strings and integration in our ``development.ini`` file

- A console script which we ran above to initialize the database

- The SQLAlchemy engine integrated into the ``Configurator`` on
  application startup

- Python modules for the SQLAlchemy models and the Pyramid views that
  go with them

- Some unit tests...yummy!
