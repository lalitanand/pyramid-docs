To code along with the BFG wiki tutorial, the developer will need a
UNIX machine with development tools (Mac OS X with XCode, any Linux or
BSD variant, etc) *or* he will need a Windows system of any kind.

The tutorial makes mention of a CDROM disk.  This is due to the fact
that the tutorial is taught "live" under some circumstances.  When it
mentions use of a CD, there are alternate instructions which follow
for people who do not have the CD.

This tutorial is known to work under :mod:`repoze.bfg` version 0.9a6.

Have fun!
