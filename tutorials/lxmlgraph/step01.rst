Step 1: Getting Started
=======================

To get started, run ``paster create -t bfg`` as described in
:ref:_project_narr to create your lxmlgraph project::


 $ paster create -t bfg
  Selected and implied templates:
    repoze.bfg#bfg  repoze.bfg starter project

  Enter project name: lxmlgraph
  ...
 $
  
You now have a project named ``lxmlgraph`` in your current directory.
We'll add to this project in subsequent steps.
