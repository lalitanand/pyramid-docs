Publishing XML with repoze.bfg
==========================================

``repoze.bfg`` is, well, fun.  It brings back the good old days of
Bobo, but with the good new days of WSGI.  With ``repoze.bfg``,
hierarchical websites are a cinch to develop.

XML is also hierarchical.  ``repoze.lxmlgraph`` is a demo application
for ``repoze.bfg`` that shows publishing a tree of XML as a
hierarchical website, while leveraging the facilities the gun gives
you.
