``lxmlgraph``: Publishing An XML Tree with :mod:`repoze.bfg`
============================================================

Hierarchical websites are easy to develop with :mod:`repoze.bfg`.
That hierarchy doesn't need to be defined by any particular sort of
graph or databsase system.  To demonstrate this, we present
``repoze.lxmlgraph``, a demo application for :mod:`repoze.bfg` that
describes publishing an XML document as a hierarchical website.
