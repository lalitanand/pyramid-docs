Using Internationalization
==========================

Setting Up Translation
----------------------

Pass a :term:`translator factory` object to your application's
:mod:`repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator` by supplying it with a
``translator_factory`` argument.  A translator factory is an object
which accepts a :term:`request` and which returns a callable.  The
callable returned by a translator factory is a :term:`translator`; it
must accept a single positional argument which represents a
:term:`translation string` and should return a fully expanded
translation of the translation string.

The exact operation of a translator is left to the implementor of a
particular translation factory.

Obtaining the Translator via :func:`repoze.bfg.i18n.get_translator`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to perform translation "by hand" in an application, use
the :func:`repoze.bfg.i18n.get_translator` function to obtain a
translator.  A translator is a callable which accepts either a
:term:`translation string` or a normal Unicode object and which
returns a Unicode object representing the translation.
